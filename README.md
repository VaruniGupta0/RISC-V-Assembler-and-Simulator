# RISC-V-Assembler-and-Simulator
A custom Assembler and Simulator for the RV32I (RISC-V) ISA subset. Translates assembly into 32-bit binary and simulates execution with real-time register and memory state tracking. Supports R, I, S, B, and J instruction formats with robust error handling for illegal instructions and immediate bounds.
